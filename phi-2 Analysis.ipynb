Mr Kumar explained afterwards that he was drunk and 'thought I'd stand a good chance' against the predators. Next level drunk: Intoxicated Rahul Kumar, 17, climbed into the lions' enclosure at a zoo in Ahmedabad and began running towards the animals shouting 'Today I kill a lion!' Mr Kumar had been sitting near the enclosure when he suddenly made a dash for the lions, surprising zoo security. The intoxicated teenager ran towards the lions, shouting: 'Today I kill a lion or a lion kills me!' A zoo spokesman said: 'Guards had earlier spotted him close to the enclosure but had no idea he was planing to enter it. 'Fortunately, there are eight moats to cross before getting to where the lions usually are and he fell into the second one, allowing guards to catch up with him and take him out. 'We then handed him over to the police.' Brave fool: Fortunately, Mr Kumar  fell into a moat as he ran towards the lions and could be rescued by zoo security staff before reaching the animals (stock image) Kumar later explained: 'I don't really know why I did it. 'I was drunk and thought I'd stand a good chance.' A police spokesman said: 'He has been cautioned and will be sent for psychiatric evaluation. 'Fortunately for him, the lions were asleep and the zoo guards acted quickly enough to prevent a tragedy similar to that in Delhi.'

He ruled over the prosperous country of Phrygia in Asia Minor and lived a life of luxury in a magnificent castle. Midas was known for his generosity and shared his abundance with his beautiful daughter. Despite his riches, Midas believed that his greatest happiness came from his golden coins. He spent his days counting his golden treasures and even covered his body with gold objects, as if he desired to bathe in them. Money became his obsession, and he was constantly consumed by thoughts of wealth.\n\nOne fateful day, Dionysus, the god of wine and revelry, visited Midas' kingdom. Among his companions was a satyr named Silenus, who became delayed on his journey. Seeking rest, Silenus took a nap in the renowned rose gardens surrounding Midas' palace. Unbeknownst to him, the king recognized him and invited him to spend a few days at his palace. Later, Midas took Silenus to Dionysus, who was immensely grateful for Midas' kindness. Dionysus, in turn, promised to fulfill any wish Midas desired.\n\nInitially, Midas hesitated but eventually made a wish that everything he touched would turn into gold. Dionysus warned him to consider the consequences, but Midas was certain of his decision. The following day, Midas eagerly anticipated the fulfillment of his wish. He extended his arm and touched a small table, which instantly transformed into gold. Excitement consumed him as he continued to touch various objects in his palace, including a chair, a carpet, a door, his bathtub, a table, and more. Each touch resulted in the object turning into gold, leaving Midas in a state of euphoria.\n\nHowever, as Midas indulged in his newfound power, he failed to realize the consequences of his wish. He decided to have breakfast and reached for a rose to smell its fragrance. To his dismay, the rose turned into gold when he touched it. This realization shattered his happiness, and he began to question the true nature of his wish. Midas continued his day, eating a grape, a slice of bread, and drinking a glass of water, only to find that each item turned into gold upon contact.\n\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Testing Block**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"prompt = \"Give me a short summary of the following text.
