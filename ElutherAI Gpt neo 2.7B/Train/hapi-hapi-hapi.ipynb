Argentinian con-artist Sofia Davila posted raunchy pictures or herself online and then flirted with unsuspecting men she had contacted on the social network, suggesting they meet up for sex. But after meeting her victims, the 21-year-old from Buenos Aires, would spike their drinks and wait for them to fall unconscious, before ransacking their homes. Buenos Aires thief Sofia Davila, 21, would start chatting to men over Facebook before suggesting that they meet up. When they did, she would spike their drinks and rob their homes after they fell unconscious . The 21-year-old posted raunchy pictures of herself on Facebook and flirt with strangers she added on the network. She was caught after trying to trick police that she was an innocent bystanders in the robberies . Diego Escalante, from Tigre, Buenos Aires, said he had been robbed after falling victim to the ploy. The 39-year-old said: 'We had been flirting with each other for about two weeks and then she suggested we get together. 'We went to a hotel and had a good time and when she suggested we meet again I didn't think anything was suspicious. 'The next time we met she came to my place and said she'd like to drink her own alcohol and poured me one too. I then began to fill ill and passed out. 'When I woke up my feet and hands were tied and there were two men in my flat taking my TV, stereo and other things.' After carrying out the ruse Davila went to the police station herself to report the robbery - claiming she had been forced to leave the flat by the men, and had been powerless to stop them. The thief has been nicknamed the 'Black Widow of Facebook'. She is now awaiting trial after admitting tricking 15 men and robbing them. Two of her accomplices will also appear in court over the crimes . But a spokesman for the police said they were suspicious, having received numerous calls from men who had been stolen from after they spent the night with a woman they met over the internet . He said: 'The problem with her statement was that we had already received a dozen complaints from other men saying they had been robbed after meeting a woman over Facebook. 'This was the first time the woman had actually shown up herself though, but because she matched the description we already had we decided to hold her for questioning. One of Davila's victims said the pair hit it off at a hotel, and he didn't think have any suspicions when they met up again at his home. He said she drugged him and he woke up with his feet tied and two men stealing his TV . 'As soon as we spoke to the victim we knew she was the woman behind the robberies and it only took a little while before we had a full confession. We also found that the man had been drugged.' Davila admitted to bedding and robbing more than 15 men and is now awaiting trial along with her two accomplices. Argentinian news website DiarioVeloz.comÂ said Davila, who worked in PR for a bowling alley, told police she was forced to commit the crimes to pay off her debts to a drug dealer.

Two millionaire people traffickers have been heard mocking the migrant boat disasters that have resulted in thousands of deaths in the Mediterranean, it has been reported. One of them, an Eritrean called Mered Medhanie, also known as The General, was heard laughing on a police wiretap about overloading migrant ships, a problem that causes them to capsize. Medhanie, 34, who is based in the Libyan capital of Tripoli, is said to have boasted: 'They say I put too many aboard, but they're the ones who want to leave in a hurry.' A second trafficker, Ermias Ghermay, who is thought to have made Â£72million with Medhanie from smuggling in the last two years, also showed callous disregard for the plight of his 'customers'. He was heard declaring last summer: 'They organised another trip a few days ago. I don't know what happened â€“ they probably died.' Ghermay, who also lives in Tripoli, was already wanted on an arrest warrant in connection with an October 2013 capsizing off Lampedusa that left 366 dead. Reports of the conversations come just days after at least 900 people were feared to have drowned in one of the worst maritime disasters since the end of World War Two. More than 1,700 have perished in the last week alone. Italian police yesterday released Ghermay's photofit as they sought to track down the pair, who are among several traffickers wanted in connection with a major human smuggling ring. Ghermay and MedhanieÂ are currently living undisturbed in Tripoli, exploiting the lawlessness in the collapse state which has allowed smugglers to operate with impunity since the fall of Gaddafi. Medhanie, who reportedly compares himself to the former Libyan dictator, and his accomplice enjoy the protection of local law authorities in the capital after it was taken over by a rival Islamist faction. A Italian naval officer stands in front of rescued migrants on board the Italian Navy vessel Bettica as they arrive in the Sicilian harbour of Augusta after being the latest group to be rescued from the Mediterranean . Terrified: Boys embrace as they arrive with migrants at the Sicilian harbor of Augusta with the Italian navy . In another wire tap recording, Medhanie, who is thought to have a wife and child in Sweden, is heard expressing scant regard for migrant suffering. 'We do an illegal job â€“ but what do you expect? We're not the government,' he says, according to La Stampa as reported by The Independent. Others reveal how his business is booming, with him heard to say: 'This year I've done well â€“ I sent off 7,000 to 8,000.' Another intercept reveals a discussion between Medhanie and his accomplices in Italy about the possibility of setting up bank accounts in the United Arab Emirates, but opting for U.S. or Canadian banks because 'they don't ask you where the money comes from.' Safe: European governments came under increasing pressure to tackle the Mediterranean's migrant crisis ahead of a summit as harrowing details emerged of the fate of hundreds who died over the weekend . Rescued migrants wait to disembark from the Italian Navy vessel Bettica Â in the Sicilian harbour of Augusta . Barbaric human traffickers are separating migrants by race, locking those with the darkest skin below deck where death is inevitable if the boat sinks, survivors have told. Teenagers arriving on the Italian island of Lampedusa told how passengers from sub-Saharan Africa were placed in the hold with no water, sunlight or, crucially, means of escape. One boy from Somalia told aid workers from Save The Children: 'The Libyans who got me to Italy are not human. 'They pushed eight Nigerians into the sea. They all drowned.' Conversely,Â Yusuf, a 17-year-old Palestinian boy who fled Gaza for Italy in February, said he was placed on an upper level with other people from the Middle East, it was reported by The Independent. Police in Palermo arrested 15 people on Monday in connection with a smuggling ring they say was masterminded by Ghermay. Prosecutors say the network had generated transactions worth hundreds of thousands of euros criss-crossing Europe as migrants paid not only to cross the Mediterranean but also to join relatives in northern Europe. Prosecutor Maurizio Scalia said based on telephone intercepts, the average cost to smuggle a migrant from Eritrea or Ethiopia to Libya ran $4,000 to $5,000, while the crossing to Italy cost an additional $1,000 to $1,500. Migrants pay hundreds of dollars more to get out of holding centers and at least another $1,000 to travel to northern Europe. Payments for each leg are made up front, often using the Islamic hawala banking system which is based on an informal honour code in which a relative in northern Europe pays a local broker. The payment information is then transmitted to the actual traffickers on the ground advising them that the leg has been paid for. European governments were today under mounting pressure to act decisively on the Mediterranean migrant crisis as harrowing details emerged of the fate of those who died in the worst tragedy to date. With the crisis set to be discussed at an emergency summit on Thursday, allegations of callous disregard for Arab and African lives are pushing EU leaders to respond to a disaster in which 800 people are feared to have died in appalling circumstances off the coast of Libya on Sunday.

A police handout showing Mohammed Ali Malek (left) and Mahmud Bikhit (right) after their arrest in Malta . The vast majority of those on board were locked in the hold or the middle deck of the 20-metre (66-foot) boat when it capsized following a collision with a Portuguese cargo ship responding to its distress signal. Only 28, including two crew members who have been arrested, survived and 24 bodies have been recovered. Survivors have described the moment the doomed ship sank, telling how how they clung to dead bodies in the pitch black sea in order to stay afloat. They also accused the captain of being drunk moments before he rammed another ship, causing the tragedy. Bangladeshi Riajul Islam, 17, said the only reason he survived was because he was on the top deck and knew how to swim. Nasir Khan, a fellow 17-year-old Bangladeshi, said he was also on the top deck and lived by clinging on to a life vest. The stricken boat initially set off from Egypt and then stopped off on the Libyan coast near the city Zuwarah to pick up more passengers, it has been reported. It set off from Libya on Saturday and sent out a distress signal shortly before midnight 120 miles south of the Italian island of Lampedusa. It later capsized.

Militants fighting for the Islamic State terror group in Syria have announced that all nurses working in areas under their control must speak English - something the NHS still hasn't introduced. Revealing plans to open a school of nursing in ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa, the extremists also disclosed the tough entry requirements for prospective medical workers. Among them are rules that applicants are no more than 25 years of age, must be willing to work anywhere inside the territory controlled by the extremists, and must speak fluent English. The latter rule is something that even the NHS has yet fully put in place, with nurses who trained in European countries still able to treat patients without any formal language checks thanks to bureaucratic rules barring the Nursing and Midwifery Council testing EU candidates. Details of the first nursing school to be opened in ISIS-held territory were revealed by on Twitter by Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently - an activist group based in the Syrian city that uses a network of brave informers to document the daily atrocities carried out by the Islamic extremists. RIBSS shared a photograph of a laminated document written in Arabic  giving details of the new medical school and listing the entry requirements for would-be nurses. It states that all candidates be aged between 18 and 25, pass an entry exam, impress during an interview, graduated from secondary school with science qualifications, be willing to travel to any ISIS-held area, and willing work for ISIS institutions for at least two years after graduating. The document also states the importance of English - saying candidates will not be accepted without knowing how to speak and understand theÂ language. This is in stark contrast with Britain where English language checks for all nurses are still not being enforced, despite legislation being passed last month making them a legal requirement. Jihadis: ISIS has English language rules for all nurses. The NHS does not have the same level of checks . Although the law has changed, the Nursing and Midwifery Council must engage in a lengthy consultation process, draft newÂ legislation and seek council approval before it can test the English language skills of nurses who trained within the EU. Students graduating from ISIS' nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after graduating. However the announcement in Raqqa promised that graduate nurses who achieved top grades and showed the most promise at the school will be considered for places as ISIS' medical school, where they can train for better paid jobs such as doctorsÂ and surgeons. ISIS' English language rules have been put in place long before the NHS has been able to bring in similarÂ checks. Militants: Students graduating from ISIS' nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after graduating . ISIS has launched English-language radio news bulletins on its Iraqi broadcast service - complete with information on the latest suicide bombings and 'martyrdom operations'. The extremist group's first English bulletin aired on Tuesday on its al-Bayan radio network, which already boasts updates in both Arabic and Russian. The nine-and-a-half minute broadcast, which begins and ends with traditional sounding Arabic music, is hosted by a man with an American accent, who takes the listener through the main events of the day. It also boasts of ISIS fighters 'roasting the flesh' of their opponents, car bombs killing people and destroying an 'idol' and so-called 'martyrdom operations'. It ends thanking the listener for 'tuning in'. Last year the law was changed to make it legal for all foreign nurses, midwives and dentists from outside the European Union to be forced to take an IELTS language exam if it was felt their English made them unsafe in a medical environment. Since then 429 doctors from outside the EU have been refused a licence to practise medicine in the UK because their English language skills are not up to scratch. Similar rules were passed last month extending those rules to prospective medical who trained inside the EU, a rule quickly adopted by doctors and dentists. The rule is still not being by theÂ Nursing and Midwifery Council, however, as the regulator requires a lengthy public consultation process before it can amend its rules. Even then the law will only apply to candidates who medical authorities judge could be a danger due to poor English language skills. In such an instance the nurse would first be required to prove sufficient EnglishÂ languageÂ experience - such asÂ from a GCSE-style qualification - or they will be forced to take the British Council's IELTS qualification, to access whether they have reached a suitable level for their job.

Now, it seems eagle-eyed Poldark fans have a new question on their lips: just where has Aidan's chest hair gone? Scroll down for video . A good smattering! Has actor Aidan Turner, who has admitted to using baby oil to show off his physique to maximum effect, been 'manscaping' his once-hairy chest in favour of a less hirsute look? Definitely no 'scything' here...Aidan's chest hair looks distinctly more unkempt in this photo shoot for BBC comedy drama Being Human, which aired earlier this year . New images have emerged of the Irish star, whose brooding good looks have seen him capture a million hearts, looking a little more, shall we say, hirsute. In images shot to promote another BBC series Being Human, the actor, who is dating fellow rising Irish star Sarah Greene, appears to have a much thicker chest of hair, suggesting that he's done away with his natural rug in a bid to really show off the muscles underneath. Although it seems the BBC make-up department may have gone for a little gentle pruning rather than offering up the full, shaven reveal in a bid to stay true to the 18th century male grooming that Ross Poldark himself might have partaken in. It's unlikely that such a character would have reached for the razor, so a smattering of hair remains. Aidan's chest has been the subject of much viewer devotion throughout the series so far, thanks to the actor disrobing in plenty of scenes. Fans have taken to Twitter to comment on the latest Poldark male grooming debate. One viewer,Â @AidanTurner_Fan, remarked that she would rather see her favourite star with a full rug: 'Asked to shave his chest hair off?!! I'd rather he had it all!' Scythed but not clean shaven?

Still brooding but a more natural image: A bearded Aidan pictured with his girlfriend Sarah Greene at the premiere for The Hobbit back in 2014 .

And some got hot under the collar at the very thought of it. Tattooed_Mummy wrote on the social media site: 'I can't think of anything other than running my hands through Ross Poldark's chest hair.' The actor has confessed that he is 'inherently lazy' when it comes to perfecting his body beautiful and only really got in shape for Poldark as filming start dates approached. 'I worked hard for six weeks, killing myself in the gym, watching what I eat and staying away from bad food. But I would never, ever do all that if I wasn't prepping for a role.

'I could take Benitez, but I'd have to take him to see a dietician first,' Ferrero told Radio Crc. 'Anyway, if Mihajlovic does leave, I've already got a replacement. You all say he's leaving, even if I don't know anything about it. 'As far as I am concerned, he's staying. If he were to leave, I'd know who to replace him with. Paulo Sousa's not going to be Sampdoria's next coach, it will be [Italian comedy actor] Lino Banfi.' Sampdoria travel to face Napoli on Sunday trailing Benitez's side by three points, but Ferrero said he would rather keep hold of the Serbian Mihajlovic, who has guided the Genoa-based club from relegation candidates to European contenders in 18 months. 'Napoli would not be taking a step backwards if they were to get Mihajlovic,' Ferrero said. 'I'm talking from my experience and I can say that Sinisa's a man of great sensitivity, a great professional and a great worker. 'He arrives two hours before training and he leaves two hours after. Above everything, he's got incredible ability and if he does leave, then I'm sure whoever gets him will be hitting the jackpot.

Mike Heatlie, 42, launched the violent attack on Fiona McCartney outside a nightclub in Edinburgh because she did not give him a cigarette. Heatlie, from Edinburgh, was once voted as one of the city's most eligible bachelors and claims to have helped train Stefani before her 2009 U.S tour.Â At the time, she described him as 'Superman'. Personal trainer Mike Heatlie, 42, (left), who claims to have previously work with Gwen Stefani, launched the violent attack on Fiona McCartney, 43, (right) outside a nightclub in Edinburgh . But Ms McCartney is now facing a Â£7,000 dental bill and says she is too frightened to leave her home after being assaulted by the personal trainer. He pleaded guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court in March to the attack. He is due to appear again on April 22 for sentencing. Speaking for the first time about the attack, Ms McCartney, a legal PA from Greenbank in Edinburgh, said: 'I used to love going out on Saturday nights. But since the attack I have been very wary and like to be home by a certain time. 'I don't like to go out to nightclubs now and I get very panicky in crowds after this unprovoked attack. 'I'm on sleeping tablets from a doctor because I don't sleep at all. I still have this constant reminder and feel I can't move on because I still have the injuries from that night. I'm reminded every day of this attack.' Ms McCartney said the incident unfolded after Heatlie approached her while she was with a friend outside The Jam House club in March last year. The Edinburgh-based trainer apparently worked on and off with the No Doubt singer (pictured) since 1997 . A testimony which claims to be from Stefani appears on Heatlie's website, which describes him as 'completely passionate' and a 'wonderful motivator' He asked the pair for a cigarette but neither woman had one to give him. He then lashed out and punched her, she said. Ms McCartney said she still suffers from numbness and aching in her mouth. She is also due to have expensive and painful dental work, over the next few months. Heatlie (pictured above) pleaded guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court to the attack . Speaking about the incident, Heatlie said: 'This was an unfortunate incident that occurred last year. 'I have been in touch with Ms McCartney and the situation is now very amicable and both parties, I'm sure, would like to move on from it.' In a text message, which Ms McCartney said had been sent by Heatlie to her partner, the trainer wrote: 'Please pass on my sincerest apologies to your partner Fiona, I wanted to get in touch but obviously couldn't with the case proceedings. 'This incident, that I have virtually no memory of, has turned my life upside down and I can't imagine how it has impacted Fiona's. 'I am so sorry, this is completely out of character for me, I've never been involved in a violent incident in my adult life.' Heatlie used an endorsement from Stefani to help promote his new studio when it opened six years ago. At the time, she described Heatlie as being 'completely passionate about health and fitness'. She said: 'Iâ€™m so happy for Mike that heâ€™s opening his own studio. I know it will be a huge success. I canâ€™t wait to start working with him again in preparation for our summer tour.

Putin has in the past fiercely attacked the United States . and the West in general, blaming them for the Ukraine crisis, . which Russia says was the result of a Western-backed 'coup' against Ukraine's former leader Viktor Yanukovich. Russia has repeatedly denied accusations from Kiev and the . West that it is supporting pro-Russian rebels with troops and . weapons in eastern Ukraine, where more than 6,000 people have . been killed since last April.

The U.S. and the European Union imposed sanctions on Russia over Moscow's annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and accusations of supporting separatists in Ukraine. At the same time, he reaffirmed his long-held criticism of what he sees as U.S. aspirations of global domination, saying Washington must learn to treat Russia as an equal partner. 'The main condition for restoring normal relations is to have respect for Russia and its interests,' Putin said on Thursday, adding that the United States 'doesn't need allies; they need vassals.' However, his criticisms of the West on Saturday were more moderate . than in some previous appearances.

Ronaldo celebrates after scoring his first goal (vs Deportivo in 2009, above), and his most recent (below) THE TOP 10 ONE-CLUB SCORERS OF ALL TIME . 10)Â Dixie Dean, Everton (1925-37) 383 . Dean is the widely regarded as greatest player to have been born on Merseyside, and scored 60Â goals in one league season in 1927/28. Impressed? He achieved that record after fracturing his skull and jaw in a motorcycling accident. Former Everton striker Dixie Dean is widely regarded as the greatest striker ever born on Merseyside . 9) Willy van der Kuijlen, PSV (1964-81) 394 . When his career started in Eindhoven, part of Der Kuijlen's motivation was to work at Phillips. He ended up with almost 400 goals, and was still only capped 22 times by the Dutch national side. Willy van der Kuijlen of PSV runs with the ball in the UEFA Cup match against Bastia in 1978 . 8) Lionel Messi, Barcelona (2004-present) 398* . Staggeringly, this Argentine forward is only 27. As the star of a mightily impressive Barelona team, expect Messi to climb up this list considerably over the next 10 years. Lionel Messi is closing in on the 400 mark with Barcelona and should rapidly rise up the scoring charts . 7) Zico, Flamengo (1971-83 and 1985-89) 401 . An attacking midfielder in the top 10? Often called the 'White Pele', Zico encapsulated a fine generation of Brazilian football, and impressed with his club side in his homeland. Over two spells with Flamengo, it's no wonder he was given a prestigious nickname. Zico of Flamengo takes on Liverpool's (l-r) Ray Kennedy, Graeme Souness and Alan Hansen in a friendly . 6) Eusebio, Benfica (1960-75) 474 . Eusebio helped Benfica to 11 league titles and seven more domestic trophies, as well as four European Cup finals. Not just a poacher, Eusebio had it all and the Mozambique-born player was a Portuguese football legend. Eusebio lead Benfica to 11 league titles and seven more domestic trophies with a staggering amount of goals . 5) Uwe Seeler, Hamburg (1953-72) 507 . Up there with Gerd Muller and Franz Beckenbauer as a German great, Seeker was not a giant but a very strong player with fantastic shooting and heading abilities. His tally probably proves that. Uwe Seeler scored over 500 goals for Hamburg and is up there with Franz Beckenbauer as a German great . 4) Jimmy McGrory, Celtic (1922-37) 522 . Regarded as the Hoops' finest ever player, McGrory netted 55 hat-tricks for the club and went on to rewrite the football record books with his unbelievable scoring feats. 3) Josef Bican, Slavia Prague (1937-48) 534 . Slavia were one of the biggest clubs in the pre-war era, led by a striker from a poor family, brought up in Austria. He fled to Czechoslovakia during the second world war, and certainly made his mark. 2) Gerd Muller, Bayern Munich (1964-79) 573 . Muller scored an incredible 85 goals in a single season as Bayern Munich claimed the Bundesliga title in 1972, and was the league's top scorer on seven occasions. Muller spent 13 campaigns with the Bavarian giants and with his goalscoring record, it's no wonder to see him near the top of the charts. Gerd Muller (centre) scored 85 goals in one league season with Bayern Munich and netted 573 in total . 1) Pele, Santos (1956-74) 1088 . Though his official record stands at 643 goals for Brazilian side Santos, and the 1088 includes strikes against a military XI, Pele tops the charts. Is he the best player of all-time, too? Pele unofficially scored 1088 goals for Santos and is widely regarded as the best player of all-time . PS... who are these Premier League sides' all-time top scorers?

Molly Wood, 74, died after the burgundy Kia Venga had its engine running and 'lurched forward', trapping her under the wheels. The pensioner's sister, 70, who was about to buy a pay and display ticket, was also injured in the incident. Tragedy: Pensioner Molly WoodÂ died after being run over by her sister's car in a Tesco car park . Investigation: The 74-year-old died after the burgundy Kia Venga, pictured, had its engine running and 'lurched forward', trapping her under the wheels . Emergency services, including an air ambulance, were called but she died at the scene outside the Tesco store in Pontefract, West Yorkshire on March 25. Her sister was also hurt in the accident but escaped with minor injuries. West Yorkshire Coroner David Hinchliff said today: 'Both ladies got out and Mrs Wood was standing in front of the vehicle while her sister went for a ticket. 'Mrs Wood was talking to some friends who were also there and it appears the engine was still running. 'It's not clear whether Mrs Wood's sister sat in the vehicle or leaned in but it was at that point that the vehicle rolled forward hitting Mrs Wood causing her to be trapped under the vehicle.' He said a provisional post-mortem examination showed Mrs Wood, of Knottingley, West Yorkshire, died of multiple injuries. Scene:Â Mrs Wood, of Knottingley, West Yorkshire, was on a shopping trip with her younger sister, who was also injured . Detective Sergeant Ann Drury said: 'The incident took place around midday on Wednesday, March 25 when the car, a burgundy coloured Kia Venga, was unoccupied and lurched forward colliding with two women who were standing towards the front of the vehicle. 'As a result of injuries sustained in the collision, a 74-year-old woman from Knottingley died at the scene. 'The other woman, 70, was not seriously injured in the incident but has been left badly shaken by what took place. 'This was a very tragic incident and I would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision and is yet to speak to police.' The inquest was adjourned for further inquiries.

Most of the compensation consisted of stock valued at $100 million. It was the largest stock package that Schmidt has received since 2011 when Google Inc. awarded him a bundle valued at $94 million at the time he relinquished the CEO's job to company co-founder Larry Page. Documents filed with regulators Thursday also disclosed that Page and the company's other founder, Sergey Brin, limited their 2014 pay to $1 each, as has been their practice for years. Payday:Â Google paid its billionaire Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt nearly $109 million last year while the company's stock slumped, it's been revealed . Schmidt also pocketed a $1.25 million salary, a $6 million bonus and perks valued at nearly $1 million. His total pay last year soared by more than five-fold from 2013 when his Google compensation was valued at $19.3 million. The hefty raise came in a year that saw Google's stock drop by 5 percent amid investor concerns about the company's big spending on far-flung projects. Analysts have also questioned whether Google will be able to maintain its dominance in Internet search as more people rely on smartphones instead of personal computers to access digital content. The downturn in Google's stock contrasted with an 11 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 index last year. Schmidt, 59, already is among the world's richest people with an estimated fortune of $9 billion, according to Forbes. Most of his wealth has been built on the Google stock that he began accumulating when he became the Mountain View, California, company's CEO in 2001. The Associated Press calculates executive compensation by including salary, bonuses, perks, above-market interest that the company pays on deferred compensation, and the estimated value of stock and stock options awarded during the year. It does not include changes in the present value of pension benefits, so the AP total can differ slightly from the total reported by company.

Pietersen returned to nets at Surrey on Monday and left The Oval after training finished just before 2pm . Pietersen was pictured driving away from The Oval in his expensive Telsa sports car . Pietersen managed a wry smile as he drove away after training on Monday afternoon . Pietersen was later pictured leaving the ground just before 2pm and is expected to step-up his county rehabilitation with  a three-day warm-up against Oxford MCCU on April 12. Ultimately, Pietersen is hoping to impress enough for Surrey to earn a re-call to the England side - possibly for this summer's Ashes rematch - having been sacked by the national side in 2014. England left for the West Indies for their upcoming Test series on Thursday, with coach Peter Moores leaving KP in no doubt that he still has a lot to prove - despiteÂ incoming England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves appearing to extended an olive branch to the exiled batsman.
